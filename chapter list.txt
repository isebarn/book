		1.1	Linear equation
			What is a linear equation (2 variables, it's graph is a line)
				x + 2 = y
				-technical terms: A linear equation with two variables (x,y) describes how the value of one of the variables depends on the value of the other variable.

			
	
				-Physicists and engineers will be familiar with Hooke's law. F = kx. 
				The law describes how hard you have to pull a spring to make it x meters longer. If k = 0.1 N/m, the equation becomes F = 0.1 * x, so to make the spring 1 meter longer, you would need F = 0.1 * 1 = 0.1 N

				-describe the equation

				-point of having an equation (graph, other simple applications)
				-this equation is a linear equation because X
			Graph (picture)
				- draw (steps?) a simple equation
				- describe the graph
			Extend to many variables
				-Lets look at a more complex equation blabla
				- ax + by+ cz + d = 0 
				- what could this equation describe
				- draw picture x + 4y + z = 8 (or something)
					- 3 pictures, one where x = 8, one with y = 2 and one where z = 8
					- coke is
