1	High School (revision)
		1.1	Linear equation
			What is a linear equation (2 variables, it's graph is a line)
			Graph (picture)
			Extend to many variables
		1.2	System of equations
			What is it? Many linear equations
			What does solve mean? Find values for variables that make each equation true. Can't always solve, *in/consistent*
		1.3	Solve equation by substitution
			When to use substitution? Few variables
