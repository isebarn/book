\paragraph{Vectors: } Its easy to think of vectors as a \textbf{length} and a \textbf{direction}, usually denoted $v = \vect{x_1,  x_2,  x_3, \dots, x_n}$, where the \textbf{x's} are usually called \color{rooj} elements\color{black}.

\

Above we have an example of  a (\textbf{2-dimensional}) vector, written both as a \color{rooj} row vector \color{black} and a \color{groen} column vector\color{black}. The vector represents a "travel" by 4 steps along the $x_1$ axis and 3 steps along the $x_2$ axis. So if you find yourself positioned at the point $(2,-4)$ and someone "applies" this vector to you, you'll be moved to $(2+4, -4+3) = (6,-1)$.

\paragraph{Properties: }


The \textbf{length} (also known as \textit{norm} or \textit{size}) of a vector is written as $|\vec{v}|$ and found with the Pythagorean-theorem:

\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

For higher dimensional vectors, the calculations look similar 

\[
|u| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2}
\]


A two-dimensional vector also has a \textbf{direction} written as $\theta_{\vec{v}}$ and calculated using absolute classic geometry

\[
\theta_{\vec{v}} = \tan^{-1}\frac{3}{4} 
\]


\paragraph{Exercise: } Find the length of the 5-dimensional vector $\vec{p} = \vect{6,2,3,9,1}$
